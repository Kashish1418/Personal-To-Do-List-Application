# Personal To-Do List Application

This project is a **Personal To-Do List Application** built in Python with two implementations:
- **CLI Version (`todo_CLI.py`)** → A menu-driven terminal application
- **GUI Version (`todo_gui.py`)** → A Tkinter-based graphical application

Both versions share the same **`tasks.json`** file for persistent task storage.

---

## ✨ Features
- Add tasks with **title, description, and category**
- Edit and update existing tasks
- Mark tasks as **completed**
- Delete tasks
- Categorize tasks as **Work, Personal, Urgent, Other**
- Persistent storage in `tasks.json` (auto-created if missing)
