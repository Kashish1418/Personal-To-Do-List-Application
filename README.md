# Project: Personal To-Do List Application
## Objective:
Develop a Personal To-Do List Application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks. This project emphasizes user interaction and file handling without the complexity of databases.
## Project Details:
**1. Functionality:**
_o Task Management:_
▪ Users can add tasks with a title and description.
▪ Users can mark tasks as completed or delete them.
_o Categorization:_
▪ Allow users to categorize tasks (e.g., Work, Personal, Urgent).
_o Persistence:_
▪ Store tasks in a local text file (JSON or CSV format) to save user progress between sessions.

**2. User Interface:**
o Use a simple command-line interface or a basic graphical interface using libraries like Tkinter.
o Provide clear prompts and feedback for user actions (adding, editing, deleting tasks).

**3. Deployment:**
o The application can be run locally on the user’s machine without any complex deployment requirements.

**5. Documentation:**
o Provide user-friendly documentation that explains how to use the application and the features available in a ppt(10-15 slides)

## 5. Testing and Documentation:
• Test the application to ensure all features work correctly and provide clear documentation in the README file.
